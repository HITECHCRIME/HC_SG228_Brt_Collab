## Lyrics

```
Something's always coming in your mind
Always searching for some preps to calm my mind
I face it every day my brother what I find is what I get 
so I'm searching till I'm dead so I'm searching till I'm dead

without any doubts, without thoughts to stash   /// a-plenty
life's a circle, we just want to make it right for us
right by all the people in surrounds, familiar faces one by one
they're the one's we cannot fall without

it's our last breath, heaven's open wide 
endless search for the context
that's what counts for ones alive

we get older with every painful crit
wiser thankfully, thoughtful in misery 
not missing the gold of the next step              //// golden experience
next brick for building rep 
surely has a price tag we often cannot take

taken away towards god you direct your eyes
it's not often that you come around from this allright
let me show you the devil's in your mind

storm is coming


```
