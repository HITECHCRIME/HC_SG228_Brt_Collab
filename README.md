## Lyrics

```
Something's always coming in your mind
Always searching for some preps to calm my mind
I face it every day my brother what I find is what I get 
so I'm searching till I'm dead so I'm searching till I'm dead

without any doubts, without any thoughts to stash   /// a-plenty
life's a circle, we just want to make it right for us
right by all the people in surrounds, familiar faces one by one
they're the one's we cannot fall without

it's our last breath, heaven's open wide 
endless search for the context
that's what counts for ones alive

we get older with every painful step taken away
wiser thankfully, (it's a) thoughtful misery (from experience)
next brick for building rep
comes with a price tag we often cannot take

storm is coming


```
